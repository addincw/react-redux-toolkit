rewrite <PostsList> so that it only selects a list of post IDs from the store instead of the entire posts array, and rewrite <PostExcerpt> so that it receives a postId prop and calls useSelector to read the post object it needs. If <PostsList> gets the same list of IDs as before, it won't need to re-render, and so only our one changed <PostExcerpt> component should have to render.

Unfortunately, this gets tricky because we also need to have all our posts sorted by date and rendered in the right order. We could update our postsSlice to keep the array sorted at all times, so we don't have to sort it in the component, and use a memoized selector to extract just the list of post IDs. We could also customize the comparison function that useSelector runs to check the results, like useSelector(selectPostIds, shallowEqual), so that will skip re-rendering if the contents of the IDs array haven't changed.
